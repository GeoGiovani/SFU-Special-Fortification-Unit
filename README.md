# S.F.U. Special Fortification Unit

## Description
S.F.U. Special Fortification Unit is a survival game built using Node.JS, 
Socket.IO, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS. My group members and I developed this game
using an Agile software development approach. This was created as a project 
for CMPT276 - Introduction to Software Engineering.
